This is a game of Mastermind where the computer is the codebreaker.

In order to play, you must think up a 4 element long sequence drawn from a pool of six colors. 

The computer will offer guesses and solicit feedback to figure out your sequence.

The computer's formula for solving the problem is based on Donald Knuth's "The Computer as Mastermind".
