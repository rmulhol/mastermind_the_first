# This is a game of Mastermind where the computer is the codebreaker.

# You get to set how many rows (anything between 2 and 6) and how many colors (between 2 and 8) we'll to play with.

# After you've chosen how many rows and colors to play, think up a secret code within those parameters. The computer will offer guesses and solicit feedback to figure out your sequence.

# The computer's formula for solving the problem is based on Donald Knuth's "The Computer as Mastermind".
